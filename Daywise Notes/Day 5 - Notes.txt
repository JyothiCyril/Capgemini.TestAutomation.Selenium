ExtentReports
--------------

Why ExtentReports?

While with Test automation using Selenium do not have in-built mechanism to capture the test results post execution.

Though TestNG API will generate the HTML report post execution,yet it get appended upon every execution.

We will not be able reterospect on the previous test execution results.

ExtentReport API to generate the HTML report for every test execution.

1. HTML report for every execution
2. Customizable with all the test status capture (Passed / Faile / Skipped)
3. Represent the overall test summary in graphical representation --> pie chart format.
4. Screenshots of the failed test to the HTML report.



1. Configure the library with ExtentReports
2. Write a generic class that can run on every test execution to read test execution results and generate the HTML report.
