Parameterization in BDD framework
---------------------------------

It is mechanism to parse the test data / input through a parameter (variable).

Parameters can be directly defined with in the acceptance criteria

* Single input parameterization : One input to one line

Repeated input parameterization

* Multiple input to a single line . One line in a code is executed repeatedly. --> Scenario
* Multiple inputs to single line that exercise the whole scenario --> Scenario outline along with Examples.

----------------------------

Tags in BDD : defining a Scenario / Scenario outline with labels.
We control the execution of Scenrion / Scenario outline from the runner class by the tags.

The scenario in the feature file should be assigned with a tag

Execute the scenario by it's tagname


tags= {"~@SmokeTest"} --> // Executes all the scenario or scenario outline except the one tagged as @SmokeTest

tags= {"@SmokeTest"} --> Execute all the test that has @SmokeTest tagging

tags= {"@End2End,@RegressionalTest"} --> if a scenario / scenario outline is either @End2End or @RegressionalTest

tags= {"@End2End","@RegressionalTest"} --> if a scenario / scenarion outline tagged as @End2End and @RegressionalTest
