Working with Xpath:
-------------------


Why to choose xpath over attribute based. / When do you choose to go with xpath?

1. When attribute based locators are not present or it is not sufficient


Priority:

1st HTML ID
2nd Name
3rd LinkText
4th Xpath


What is a xPath?

xPath is an address of an element from the HTML strcuture page.

It is represent in a syntax format which is collection different wildcard chars.

How to write an xpath expression?




<input type="text" onblur="fieldTrack(this);" name="name493336bb" value="" style="width:185px;" maxlength="61">

<input type="text" onblur="fieldTrack(this);" name="namecbfc9aba" value="" style="width:185px;" maxlength="61">


Full xpath / absolute xpath : Full address of an element start from the root of the page.
 always uses '/' to traverse to the child elements.

html/body/center/form/div/table[2]/tbody/tr[3]/td[3]/input

relative xpath : shortest path or address of an element. "//" for reaching the elements directly from the descendents.

//table[2]/tbody/tr[3]/td[3]/input


Relative can written using functions.

xpath expression by attributes , text(), contains(), groupindex()

xpath by attribute:

//TagName[@AttributeName='AttributeValue']

//input[@maxlength='61']




<input type="button" name="btnchkavailcbfc9aba" value="Check availability" onclick="javascript:getreplies(document.forms[0].logincbfc9aba.value,document.forms[0].namecbfc9aba.value);" class="btn_checkavail">

//*[@value='Check availability'] 

<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" style="background-color: #FACB00;border: 1px solid black;font-family:MS Sans Serif;font-size:15px;">

xpath syntax by text()

//tagname[@text()='Value']

//tagName[contains(text(),'textvalue')]


/html/body/center/form/div/table[2]/tbody/tr[3]/td[3]/input

//*[@id="tblcrtac"]/tbody/tr[3]/td[3]/input

1. Open the browser
2. Open rediff URL
3. Click create account link based on link text
4. Check if the user is landed on registration page
5. Enter full name as Kim smith
6. Enter email id as smith_test
7. click check availality button


RediffPages --> all the element in the above scenario should added in the pages.

TestNG - Next Generation.

It is a testing framework (API : library) used along with Selenium for building the effective automation framework ( guidelines)

TestNG is an API is been inspired by one open source unit testing API called Junit

Junit API used for unit testing the code used by developers.

TestNG is used by the tester for enhancing the test code written using Selenium & Java.


1. Install TestNG into Eclipse IDE
2. Configure the testng library into the project (TestAutomation.Selenium)

How TestNG is used to customize the Selenium Java code?
What are the features of TestNG that can benefit to enhance the code to increase the modularity & reusablity etc.

Features that can be implemented using TestNG:

1. Will automatically generate the HTML report post execution
2. Control the flow of execution using different annotations in testng
3. Prioritization , Enable / Disable the test , grouping etc.
4. Parallel testing
5. Cross browser testing
6. Parameterization --> xml / Object[][]
7. Assertions : check points
8. log the status into HTML report
9. Single test / execute the test suite which one or more can be executed either sequentially or parallely.


**************************************************************************

What is an annotation?

Annotations are pre-defined class from TestNG library.

These are used as meta-data to declare a method as a TestNG method.

** The methods will be controlled by the annotation at the run session.

Depends on the type of annotation used.


Types of annotations :

1. Annotations used as TestFixtures:
TestFixtures are the methods used run before  or After a Suite / Test / Class / Method.

The lines of code to be exercised as pre-requisites / post -conditions should be written under these methods.

Pre-conditions : expected to run before a Suite / Test / Class / method
pre-fixed with "@Before" => @BeforeSuite, @BeforeTest, @BeforeClass, @BeforeMethod.


post - conditions : expected to run after a Suite / Test/ Class / method
pre-fixed with "@After"  --> @AfterSuite, @AfterTest, @AfterClass, @AfterMethod


2. Annoation used as Test case : Only one annotation "@Test".

** The nature of @Test annotation is declare a method as test case, that has some potential functionality under test.

A method below the @Test annotation is called as test cases and it is executed to define it the specific test is passed / failed / skipped.


3. Annotation used for parameterization : @Parameter & @DataProvider.

** Static methods cannot be annotated.

Structure of TestNG test suite: in the Xml format

Suite --> Test --> Class --> Methods


Example : Internet Banking application

Login

1. FundTransfer --> Class 1
2. CCBillPayment -- > Class 2
3. UtilityBillPayment --> Class 3

Logout
